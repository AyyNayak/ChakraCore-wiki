# ChakraCore Maintainers' Workflow

Small changes are often made by the Wiki maintainers directly via the Wiki
interface, and those changes are not automatically mirrored in this repo.

Due to low volume of changes, this repo (the ChakraCore-wiki repo) is manually
(rather than automatically) kept in sync with the Wiki at
https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki.

It is recommended to configure your remotes as follows to reduce ambiguity:

    git remote add repo https://<username>:<token>@github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore-wiki.git
    git remote add wiki https://<username>:<token>@github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore.wiki.git

The `wiki` remote is updated when maintainers manually make changes through the
GitHub Wiki interface.

The `repo` remote is updated when commits are made directly to this repo.

To avoid merge conflicts, before making changes via this repo or merging any
pull requests, please manually sync changes from the `wiki` remote as follows:

    git checkout master
    git fetch --all
    git merge --ff wiki/master
    git push repo master
